          <strong><a href="https://www.novotelnewcastlebeach.com.au/"> Novotel </a>, Newcastle</strong>
          </br>
          The <a href="https://www.novotelnewcastlebeach.com.au/"> Novotel </a>, in Newcastle is a fantastic choice for those seeking convenient and comfortable accommodation 
          during their stay in Newcastle. Our reception will be held at the Novotel, making it an ideal option for those
           attending the event. By booking a room at the <a href="https://www.novotelnewcastlebeach.com.au/"> Novotel </a>, you will not only have a comfortable place to stay, 
           but you will also be eligible for a 10% discount.
          <br>
          <br> For those who plan to stay in Newcastle there are a variety of options if the Novotel is not your preference. Hotels such as the Quest Newcastle and the Mercure Newcastle provide comfortable accommodation at a more reasonable price. For budget-conscious travelers, there are options such as the Ibis Budget Newcastle. Additionally, travelers can consider renting an Airbnb, which can be a better option for Canadians.

          <strong>Visas</strong>
          </br>
          Canadian citizens traveling to Australia for our wedding must obtain an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) 
          prior to their trip. The ETA is a simple online visa that allows stays of up to three months. To obtain an ETA,
           Canadian citizens can apply through the Australian Department of Home Affairs website or a travel agent. 
           It is important to verify the latest visa requirements before traveling to Australia for a wedding.

          <strong> Arriving in Sydney, Australia</strong>
          </br>
          When landing at Sydney Airport, you have the option to reach Newcastle by train or by driving a rental car.
           The quickest and preferred option is to take the direct XPT train link from Sydney's Central Station to
            Newcastle Station, which takes approximately 2 hours, if you dont book ahead you can take the CCN line but it a non-express line. Alternatively, you can also rent a car and drive to 
            Newcastle, which will take around 2.5 hours. Just remember to drive on the left side of the road in Australia! 
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong> Local SIM Cards</strong>
          </br>
          Consider getting an amaysim plan for your trip to Australia. Their $10 AUD plan includes 10GB of data for 
          7 days with unlimited calls and texts. Simply visit <a href="https://www.amaysim.com.au/plans/short-plans/">https://www.amaysim.com.au/</a> to choose this plan and 
          activate your SIM card online for a convenient and cost-effective mobile experience.
